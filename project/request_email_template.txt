Hello, Admin!
There has been a connection request from the following user:

User id: USER_ID
User inn: USER_INN
User name: USER_NAME

There is a need to connect to the user's profile:

Competitor inn: COMPETITOR_INN
Competitor name: COMPETITOR_NICKNAME
Competitor web: COMPETITOR_WEBSITE

To connect COMPETITOR_NICKNAME to the user USER_NAME, you need to write the scraper for
the COMPETITOR_WEBSITE and reply to the email message with "CONNECT"

Ignore the message if the scraper can't be created for some reason!

With best wishes, sincerely yours, 2024 Costing, Inc.
